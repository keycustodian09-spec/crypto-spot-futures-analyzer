# TradeLens — Crypto Spot & Futures Analyzer

TradeLens is a Claude plugin for structured educational analysis of cryptocurrency spot and futures trades.

## Core modes

1. **Screenshot Analyzer** — TradingView and exchange screenshots, including open spot/futures positions.
2. **Trade / Position Review** — entry, stop, targets, leverage, margin, liquidation and risk/reward.
3. **Coin / Market Analysis** — technical structure plus relevant fundamentals and catalysts.
4. **Futures Context** — funding, open interest, leverage and derivatives risk when verified data is available.
5. **Position & Risk Calculator** — deterministic position sizing, R:R, P&L, fees, funding and DCA arithmetic.

## v0.3 architecture

This version is intentionally serverless. It uses:

- one Agent Skill for analysis behavior;
- one local Python calculation helper;
- optional current web/search capabilities available in Claude at runtime.

It does not require exchange API keys, place trades, transfer funds, or monitor markets in the background.

## Design principles

- No invented live prices, news, funding, OI, unlocks or exchange terms.
- Screenshot facts are kept separate from interpretation.
- Conditional scenarios instead of guaranteed directional calls.
- Risk math is deterministic when inputs are available.
- Affiliate/referral information is narrowly triggered, code-first, disclosed and secondary to analysis.
- No trade execution or financial-asset transfers.

## Testing

Use the prompts and expected behavior in `TESTS.md` before submission.

## Safety and scope

TradeLens provides educational analysis and decision support. It does not execute financial transactions and does not promise returns.
